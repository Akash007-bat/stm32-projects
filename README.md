This project investigates the development and implementation of an efficient algo-
rithm for computing the exponential function ex on an STM32 microcontroller. By
utilizing the binary expansion method, the proposed approach ensures both com-
putational efficiency and precision, making it suitable for real-time applications in
embedded systems. The accurate calculation of ex has significant implications in
fields such as control systems, signal processing, and mathematical modeling, where
precise numerical computations are critical.
